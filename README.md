![](https://flat.badgen.net/badge/platform/macOS,Windows,Linux?list=|)

## Overview

ðŸ”º NOTICE: I'm primarily a Windows user, I've used Mac for about 10 years then moved to windows and occasionally used linux(arch and fedora). 

Here are my dotfiles. There's no one line install, still working on it.

## Common

- neovim [Meovim](https://github.com/mino29/meovim)

### Theme

ðŸ”º NOTICE: I used nord theme wherever possible, if it's too much hassle, I often use dracula instead.
The wallpaper included is what I made using Photoshop for like 5 minutes. Feel free to use it.

### Cross-platform programs

I use cross-platform programs whenever possible, so I don't get locked up in a specific ecosystem.
In the common folder are thoese programs configs that shared the same config files across different OSes. 

- nushell (blazing fast shell, not supporting conda ATM is a bummer though)
- font: Hack NF
