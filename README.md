# My Dotfiles

## Overview

I'm primarily a Windows user, I've used Mac for about 10 years then moved to windows and occasionally used linux(arch and fedora). 

Here are my dotfiles.


## Theme

My systems generally have Nord based themes, so if you are a big fan of Nord, you may find these configs helpful.

## Windows

- windows terminal
- powershell profile
- winfetch
- scoop config

- lf
and more


## Linux

- zsh
- powerlevel10k

and more
