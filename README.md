# My Dotfiles

## Overview

I'm primarily a Windows user, I've used Mac for about 10 years then moved to windows and occasionally used linux(arch and fedora). 

Here are my dotfiles.

## Common

### Theme

I used nord theme wherever possible, if it's too much hassle, I often use dracula instead.
The wallpaper included is what I made using Photoshop for like 5 minutes. Feel free to use it.

### Cross-platform programs

I use cross-platform programs whenever possible, so I don't get locked up in a specific ecosystem.
In the common folder are thoese programs configs that shared the same config files across different oses.
